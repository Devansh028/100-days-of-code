# Day 12 – Recursion + DP + LinkedList + HashMap

## Questions:

1. Fibonacci with memoization — return the nth Fibonacci number.
2. Detect cycle in a linked list using Floyd’s cycle detection.
3. Demonstrate HashMap internal working, collisions, updates, iteration.

## Concepts Learned:

- Top-down DP with memoization
- Fast & slow pointer technique
- HashMap behavior (O(1) average operations)
